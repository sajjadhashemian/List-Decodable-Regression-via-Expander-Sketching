# expander-ldr Documentation

This package implements the **expander-sketched list-decodable regression** algorithm of Pourali–Hashemian–Ardeshir-Larijani (2025) in a modular, scikit-learn compatible way.

## Contents

- [Algorithm](algorithm.md) – description of the full pipeline and its components.
- [Theory](theory.md) – assumptions and guarantees, and how they map to code.
- [API Reference](api.md) – public classes and functions.
- [Experiments](experiments.md) – how to run and extend experiments.

The documentation assumes basic familiarity with linear regression, robust statistics, and Python/NumPy.
